# Power series experiments

Exercising [Eric Niebler's range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) with some power series calculations inspired by [Doug McIlroy's work](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/powser.html), and additional views inspired by the Haskell Prelude.

A [series of blog posts](http://www.elbeno.com/blog/?p=1118) follows the journey I had writing this code.
